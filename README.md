The purpose of this study is to:
1. Implement and compare **Ensemble Learning** techniques (Bagging and Boosting) with **Evolutionary Learning** using DEAP.
2. Evaluate and analyze the performance of these approaches on the **Higgs Boson Detection** dataset.
3. Understand the strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs between these methods.
